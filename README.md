# Telegram Bot: ATM Finder

## Introduction

This Telegram bot will use your current location to show you the ATMs that are nearest to you. This bot will show you up to 3 ATMs within a 500mts radius of your current location, using an euclidean distance measure.

To use it, you will need to run this server and use the bot username: *atmmap_bot* to talk to it.

You can also reset the bot token defined in the Dockerfile.
